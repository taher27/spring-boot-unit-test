Test generated by RoostGPT for test JavaTest1601 using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-0613

1. Default Constructor Test: Test if the default constructor is creating an instance of the Response class successfully. This is to ensure that an object can be created without passing any parameters.

2. Null Test: Test if the default constructor is returning a non-null object of the Response class. This is to ensure that an instance of the class is being created.

3. Type Test: Test if the object created by the default constructor is indeed an instance of the Response class. This is to ensure that the correct object is being created.

4. Inheritance Test: Test if the Response class is correctly inheriting from its superclass. This is to ensure that the inheritance hierarchy is correctly established.

5. Method Availability Test: Test if all the methods and variables from the superclass are available in the instance created by the default constructor. This is to ensure that all the inherited methods and variables are accessible.

6. Super Constructor Test: Test if the superclass constructor is being called correctly when an instance of the Response class is created. This is to ensure that the superclass constructor is being invoked.

7. Exception Test: Test if any exceptions are being thrown when an instance of the Response class is created using the default constructor. This is to ensure that no unexpected errors occur during object creation.
