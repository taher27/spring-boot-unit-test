Given the limited context and functionality of the provided code snippet, there are not many test scenarios we can develop. The code defines an empty constructor for a class named `ToDo` that extends some unspecified superclass. However, here are a few general test scenarios:

1. **Instantiation Test**: Test if a `ToDo` object can be instantiated using the default constructor. This validates if the object creation process is working correctly.

2. **Superclass Constructor Invocation Test**: Test if the superclass constructor is properly invoked when a `ToDo` object is instantiated. This can be done by checking if all the fields inherited from the superclass are correctly initialized.

3. **Persistence Annotation Test**: Test if the `ToDo` class is correctly recognized as an entity by the persistence framework (like Hibernate). This can be done by checking if the `ToDo` objects can be correctly stored in and retrieved from a database.

4. **Id Generation Test**: Test if the id of the `ToDo` object is correctly auto-generated by the persistence framework. This can be done by creating a `ToDo` object, storing it in the database, and then retrieving it to check if its id is correctly populated.

5. **Inheritance Test**: Test if the `ToDo` class correctly inherits from its superclass. This can be done by checking if a `ToDo` object can be used wherever an object of its superclass is expected.

Remember, these are just hypothetical scenarios, as the actual test scenarios would heavily depend on the specific functionality and business logic of the `ToDo` class and its superclass.
